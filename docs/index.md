# plumber Provider

This provider allows you to manage [plumber](https://github.com/batchcorp/plumber) running in server mode.

It is **NOT** recommended to hardcode the token in your terraform files. You should provide via a variable
to the terraform command, or use the environment variable `PLUMBER_TOKEN`.

## NOTES

* Relay updating is not supported yet
* Kafka is the only kind of connection supported. We will have all others added very soon!


## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    plumber = {
      version = ">= 0.1.0, < 1.0.0"
      source  = "batchcorp/plumber"
    }
  }
}

provider "plumber" {
  plumber_token      = "your-plumber-servers-token"
  address            = "address-of-your-plumber-server:9090"
}
```

## Argument Reference

---

- `address` - (String) - The address of the Plumber server.
- `connection_timeout` - (Number) The connection timeout for the Plumber server. (Default: `5s`)
- `plumber_token` - (String) - Plumber API token
